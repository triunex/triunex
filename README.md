## Mission: Building the Future of AI through Revolutionary Architecture

I'm architecting the **next generation of AI systems** that are fundamentally different from everything that exists today. My focus is on creating **efficient, cost-effective, and powerful AI models** that will power the future of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).

### What We're Building at Nelieo

**The new type of AI architecture** designed to address the fundamental problems in current AI systems:

- **Making AI models cheaper to build, train, and deploy** - Revolutionary efficiency in architecture design
- **Eliminating computational redundancy** - Optimizing every parameter and operation
- **Building truly autonomous, self-evolving systems** - AI that learns and improves itself
- **Designing the foundation for AGI & ASI** - Creating the blueprint for superintelligent systems

Nelieo isn't just another AI company. We're **redefining how AI architectures should be built** from the ground up.

## The Future

**The current AI landscape is inefficient.**

Large models trained on massive compute, costing billions, solving generalized problems. We're changing that.

At Nelieo, we're building **architectures that are smarter by design, not by brute force**. Where efficiency and power aren't trade-offs - they're synergies.

**Aetherion isn't just another neural network.** It's a fundamental rethinking of how intelligence should be structured. It's what comes after Transformers. It's the architecture for AGI.

_(The most cutting-edge work happens in private repositories and proprietary systems. For technical discussions, demonstrations of Aetherion research, collaboration opportunities, or investment inquiries, reach out directly.)_

**Exploring the question:** How do we build AI that doesn't just match human intelligence, but fundamentally surpasses it through architectural innovation?
